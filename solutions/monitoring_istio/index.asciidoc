= Istio Microservice Monitoring

== Core elements of the problem and its solution

Standardization of communication in a kubernetes cluster between different microservices. Subsequent monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. 

We used the following tools to solve the problem:
* Rancher (Docker)
* Kubernetes
* Istio
* Grafana
* Prometheus

Our solution is tailored for when istio is running on the existing cluster and monitoring of the various microservices is attempted.


== Introduction

The prerequisite is that there is a Kubernetes cluster with microservices and istio is already running on it.(In case istio isn't installed already: https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#download)
